## Contributing
In case you're a roleplaying game geek who also wants to contribute directly, we're open to pull requests. Typo fixes and editing would be wonderful.

- Inkscape (http://inkscape.org/) to edit svg documents
- the fonts i used (es. for linux users: copy them into ~/.fonts/)

To do it simple, since gs comes with almost every gnu/linux distros, just type:
- gs -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -q -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=Final_Work.pdf  pdf1.pdf pdf2.pdf ...
